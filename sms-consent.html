        <h1>SMS Consent & Opt-In Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Three Day Weekend, LLC</strong></p>
        <p>Last Updated: January 10, 2025</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This page documents how Three Day Weekend, LLC collects consent from users who wish to
            receive SMS text messages. We are committed to transparency and compliance with all
            applicable SMS messaging regulations, including TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act)
            and CTIA guidelines.
        </p>

        <div class="consent-box">
            <strong>Important: SMS Consent is Optional</strong>
            <p>
                Opting in to receive SMS text messages from Three Day Weekend is <strong>completely optional</strong>
                and is NOT required to access or use any of our services. You can purchase, use, and receive full
                support for our automation and back-office solutions without ever providing consent to receive text messages.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>How Consent is Collected</h2>

        <div class="consent-box">
            <strong>Important: Phone Number Collection vs. SMS Opt-In</strong>
            <p>
                Phone numbers are collected for essential service functions such as account management,
                customer support, and appointment scheduling. <strong>Opting in to receive promotional or
                informational SMS messages is a completely separate, optional choice</strong> that is NOT
                required for any service access.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>1. Explicit Opt-In Process</h3>
        <p>
            Users who wish to receive SMS messages from Three Day Weekend must explicitly opt in
            through one of the following methods:
        </p>

        <div class="consent-box">
            <strong>Express Written Consent - Separate from Service Registration</strong>
            <p>
                Users may provide their phone number for service purposes (account creation, customer support,
                consultation scheduling). <strong>SMS messaging consent is collected separately</strong> through
                an optional, unchecked checkbox that is distinct from phone number collection for service use.
            </p>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Contact Form:</strong> Phone numbers may be collected for service purposes (support, scheduling). A separate, optional, unchecked checkbox allows users to opt in to SMS notifications. The checkbox is distinct from the phone number field and clearly labeled for SMS consent only.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Request:</strong> Users already using our services can email info@threeday.llc to specifically request SMS opt-in</li>
            <li><strong>Verbal/Written Agreement:</strong> Existing customers can opt in to SMS during phone calls or in-person meetings, which is documented in our CRM as a separate action from service registration</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Example Consent Language</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>SMS opt-in is voluntary and separate from service access.</strong> Users are not required
            to consent to text messaging in order to use our services.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Sample Opt-In Form Text:</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Phone Number:</strong> [__________________]<br>
                <em style="font-size: 0.85em;">(Used for account access, customer support, and appointment scheduling)</em>
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; padding-top: 1.5rem; border-top: 2px solid #E5E7EB;">
                <strong>Optional: Receive SMS Notifications</strong><br>
                ☐ I agree to receive text messages from Three Day Weekend, LLC at the phone number provided above.
                I understand that message and data rates may apply, and I can opt out at any time by replying STOP.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.9em; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <em>Note: The SMS checkbox above must be unchecked by default and is visually separated from the phone
                number field. Opting in to SMS is completely optional and is not a condition of purchasing or using
                Three Day Weekend services. The phone number is collected for service purposes only.</em>
